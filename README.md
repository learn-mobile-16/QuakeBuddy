# Quake Buddy

Quake Buddy is a refined and well-commented project that I've published to Google Play since graduating from Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree on 10-Feb-2017. The most current version of QuakeBuddy is 1.2. Quake Buddy can be downloaded from the Google Play <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gumgoose.app.quakebuddy" target="_BLANK">here</a>.

"You can sort by most recent earthquakes and filter them by entering a time frame or minimum magnitude value. You can also activate the 'Tsunami Watch' theme to see basic Tsunami alerts developing so You stay on Your guard."
