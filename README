# Quake Buddy

Quake Buddy is a refined and well-commented project that I published to Google Play after graduating from Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree. The most current version of the app is 1.2 and lives here. Quake Buddy can be downloaded from the Play Store <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gumgoose.app.quakebuddy" target="_BLANK">here</a>.

From Google Play:
"You can sort by most recent earthquakes and filter them by entering a time frame or minimum magnitude value. You can also activate the 'Tsunami Watch' theme to see basic Tsunami alerts developing so You stay on Your guard."

This app features:
- API integration, JSON parsing
- LoaderManager/LoaderCallbacks
- Swipe-to-Refresh
- a custom "Quake" object
- ListView adapter
- settings fragment
- built-in WebView extension
- change log dialog
- custom XML layouts for all sized screens
- support for Android SDK 15 (4.0.3 ICS) and above

The future version(s) aim(s) to incorporate:
- Butter Knife
- RecyclerView instead of ListView
- built-in Google Maps extension
- search filter by physical device location
